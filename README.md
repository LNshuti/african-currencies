There is no such thing as a low-energy rich country, claims one [popular Twitter Visualization](https://twitter.com/DrTBehrens/status/1761132691871711614). This repo examines these claims, focusing on African countries. Given that most of the poor countries in the world are African(1), we should be able to show that they consume less energy than more affluent countries. Using Open Source Databases, we attempt to prove that **as a country's energy generation and consumption increase, other economic indicators associated with wealth, such as GDP per Capita or the Life Expectancy at birth, follow suit**.
